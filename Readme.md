# Grammar Cards!

Generate flash cards to help me practice agreement of person, gender, number, and register (formal vs. familiar) in Spanish.

It takes lists of lexical items and grammatical parameter sets from the disk and generates a fresh deck of cards on each run.  This means, for example, different nouns and adjectives get used to form the same structures, so I can't just memorize stock phrases.

The card view is in the terminal and requires <code>ncurses</code> to be installed under <code>/usr/lib</code>.
